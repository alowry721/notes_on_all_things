# RFC 1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets

## Introduction

enterprise - an entity autonomously operating a network using TCP/IP 

describes address allocation for private internets

## Motivation

Addesses two concerns
* Globally unique address space will become exhausted
* ISPs won't be able to deal with the routing overhead

RFCs 1518 and 1519 on IP Address Allocation via CIDRs

### Three enterprise categories
* Hosts that don't require access to hosts in other enterprises (private - unambiguous within an enterprise but may be ambiguous between enterprises)
* Hosts that need access to a limited set of outside services (private - same as above un within, am between)
* Hosts that need network layer access outside the enterprise (public - globally unambiguous)

### Some Examples where external connectivity probably not required

* Airport's arrival/departure displays 
* local workstations like cash registers, money machines, and equipment
* enterprises using a few application layer gateways to connect internal to Internet.  Internal network can use non-unique IPs
* Interfaces or routers on an internal network 

## Private Address Space
Three ranges allocated for private address space depending on company needs

24 bit block     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
20 bit block     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
16 bit block     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

An enterprise using one of these spaces can do so without any coordination with IANA or an Internet Registry

Any enterprise that needs globally unique address space is required to obtain from 

First step is determining which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity outside the enterprise.  It's good to know if it might change from public to private later.  Moving from private to public will require:
* change of IP address
* changes to DNS entries
* changes to config files on other hosts which reference it

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Private Addess Space

### Advantages
* For the Internet at large, it conserves the globally unique address space
* For enterprises, they gain a lot of flexibility in network design with a lot more IP addresses which can be used 

### Disadvantages
* ISPs not using route filters to guard against IPs in the private address space
* Enterprises will potentially need to update a lot of fields should they decide to move a host from public to private.  Tools like DHCP could be used to facilitate remembering

## Operational Considerations

* design private part of network first and use private address space for all internal links
* then move on to public subnets at the locations needed and design external connectivity
* routers which connect enterprises to external networks are set up with appropriate packet and routing filters at both ends
* filter any private networks from inbound routing information
* DNS clients outside the enterprise should never see the addresses in the private address space
