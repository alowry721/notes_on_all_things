# RFC 793 - TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL (TCP)

## Introduction

### Motivation

*TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network applications*

*layered protocol architecture just above a basic Internet Protocol_*

As long as there is an IP layer below, TCP should be able to function across most any communications network.

                        +---------------------+
                        |     higher-level    |
                        +---------------------+
                        |        TCP          |
                        +---------------------+
                        |  internet protocol  |
                        +---------------------+

### Scope

*process-to-process communication service in a multinetwork environment*

*host-to-host protocol in common use*

### About this Document

*represents a specification of the behavior required of any TCP implementation*

### Interfaces
Both catered to depending on the OS.  
* One above to user side process
* One below to internet protocol

### Operation

To provide reliable communicaitons atop an unreliable communicaitons network, the following must be considered:

#### Basic Data Transfer
* package octect streams into segments for transmission through internet system
* push function to push readied segments when able

#### Reliability
*must recover from from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order by the internet communication system*
* ACK - does this by each octect assigned a sequence num and requiring a positive acknowledgement (ACK) from recieving TCP*
* Damage handled by a checksum for each segment

#### Flow Control
* windowing - ACK indicates a range of acceptable sequence numbers beyond the last segment successfully received

#### Multiplexing
* Ports are used to separate processes.  
* Combined with host obtained from IP layer, this forms a socket
* Binding of ports to processes handled by the os

#### Connections
* Refers to the unique sockets, sequence numbers, and window sizes between two processes
* handshake mechanism with "clocked based sequence numbers" is used to ensure stable init of cxn

#### Precedence and Security
* Users indicate the amount of security they want
